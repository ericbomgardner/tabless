# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Tabless website or app for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information we collect

We do not collect any of your information.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Passwords are hashed, not stored, using industry-standard methods (currently bcrypt).

Accessing, changing, or deleting information
You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Overcast iOS app.

Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.

Overcast may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.

## Third-party links and content

Since Tabless is a web browser, it displays links and content from third-party sites. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.
